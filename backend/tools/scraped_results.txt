================================================================================
Before you Start
Who can use this feature
Available on
any plan
Anyone with
can edit
access to a file can create and edit guides
Guides are helpful when you're trying to precisely position layers or objects in your designs.
Enable rulers
Before you can add guides to your file, you must enable rulers on the canvas.
Open the
Main menu
.
Hover over
View
and select
Rulers
.
Create a new guide
To create a new guide, click and drag on the horizontal or vertical ruler to pull the guide onto the canvas.
You can also create a new guide from an existing guide by holding
Option
(Mac) or
Alt
(Windows), then clicking and dragging from an existing guide.
Figma has both canvas and frame level guides for positioning and aligning objects in your designs.
The dotted line acts as visual indicator that your guide is intersecting with a frame on the canvas.
View distances (redlines)
With a top-level frame selected, hold
Option
(macOS) or
Alt
(Windows) as you click and drag out a guide. You will see the distance (in pixels) between the guide and the frame. This distance is also reflected in the ruler. When the guide intersects your frame it will begin measuring distances between the guide and objects in the frame.
When a frame is selected, the rulers are highlighted in blue, calling attention to the coordinates of the frame on your canvas. When you select objects in the frame, you'll see the same blue highlights for the selected object.
Guides inside frames are recognized as another object in the frame. This means you can view redline distances between the guide itself and other elements in the frame, as well as the parent frame.
Remove guides
To remove a guide, you can do any of the following:
Click and drag the guide back to the rulers
Select the guide and press
delete
Right-click on the guide and select
Remove guide

Welcome to Figma 101!
Figma is a collaborative interface design tool thatâs taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!
Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional âofflineâ apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.
In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designerâs workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.
What weâll cover in Figma 101
This course aims to introduce all of the key functions in Figma. Weâll achieve that by building a set of app screens together. Weâll also use Figmaâs prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning you can experience how the screens will behave like they would if this were a functional app ready for people to download and use. Youâll be able to share your prototypes with friends, or develop your design further and add it to your portfolio!
Before we get started
Before we get started with todayâs lesson,
take a sec to work through our quick one-minute goal setting exercise
. We want to make sure youâre getting the most out of this course... and that by the end of it youâve mastered the basics of Figma and accomplished any personal learning goals!
Todayâs learning objectives
Find our way around Figmaâs interface
Experiment with some of the key functions
Learn important keyboard shortcuts
Figure out how to control the interface (zooming etc.)
Create Frames, Rectangles, and Text layers
Use Arrange and Align commands
Time to complete:
30 minutes
Todayâs tutorial
1. Set up your Figma account
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to
www.figma.com
, clicking âGet startedâ, entering your details, and completing a quick verification activity. Once youâve done that, Figma will guide you to a screen with a few more onboarding questions before throwing you right into a project file with some examples of what you can create using Figma .
2. Take a look around the Figma interface
The look and feel of the Figma interface is quite minimal, but it belies a set of powerful features. Hereâs an explanation of the interfaceâs main areas (labeled above):
Menu:
Unlike regular desktop design apps, Figmaâs menu can be found by clicking the Figma logo in the top-left of the screen. Take a minute to browse around this dropdown and see whatâs there! Here, you can also search for specific commands you need. Click on the magnifying glass where it says âQuick actionsâ¦â and type in ârectangleâ and youâll quickly find the Rectangle Tool, complete with a handy reminder of its keyboard shortcut (itâs [[R]], by the way).
Tools:
Here you can quickly access the tools youâre likely to use most often: move, frame, shapes, pen, text, etc. (Weâll cover these tools in the next couple of days!)
Actions:
This area shows extra options for whatever object you have selected on your canvas. When no object is selected (as shown above), Figma displays the file name.
Collaboration and View Options:
The right side of the toolbar is where you can find the file sharing functions and see who else is viewing your file in real-time. Youâll also find view and zoom options.
Layers:
Also known simply as the âleft sidebar,â this is where every element in the file is listed and organized into Pages, Frames and Groups.
Canvas:
â
This is where youâll create all of your designs!
Properties:
The properties panel offers contextual information and settings for whatever object is selected. In the image above, weâre seeing options for the Canvas itself. By default, youâre viewing the Design tab, but there is also a separate tab for setting up a Prototype âweâll cover this later in the week.
3. Start a new design file
Now that youâve found your way around, letâs start making stuff! Letâs start a new project by clicking the Menu button (Figmaâs logo) in the top left corner and then selecting File and âNew design file.â Doing this should automatically create a new file with an empty canvas in a new tab on your browser.
4. Create a Frame
In Figma, a Frame is essentially a container for other elements. If youâve used Sketch or Adobe Illustrator before, it functions in the same way as an Artboard. Press [[F]] to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame tool icon in the toolbar at the top of the window. Equally, if youâre used to Sketch, you can also hit [[A]] (for âArtboardâ).
Note that weâll often refer to keyboard shortcuts in these tutorials. Itâs worth getting in the habit of using these shortcuts because theyâll significantly speed up your workflow further down the line. In the short videos through this course, youâll see the keystrokes we use on Mac computers.
There are a couple of ways of creating a Frame. We can either click and drag in the canvas area, or we can select a pre-set Frame size from the Properties panel on the right hand side of the window. We chose the iPhone SE template. Try both ways now!
5. Practice zooming in and out
Youâll probably find yourself wanting to zoom in and out quite a bit in Figma, particularly once we start working with multiple Frames. The standard zoom commands are accessed with [[â]][[+]] and [[â]][[-]]. Try it now!
Those commands will just focus in on the center of your current view. But there are some other handy zoom commands available:
[[Shift â§]][[2]] will zoom to the current selection
[[Shift â§]][[1]] will zoom to show the whole canvas
Select the Frame by clicking on its name, then try alternating these commands to switch between the selection and the whole canvas.
Finally, hereâs an *extra* handy zoom tip to move between Frames without having to zoom in and out the whole time:
[[N]] will zoom to the next Frame
[[Shift â§]][[N]] will zoom to the previous Frame
6. Practice using the hand tool to move around the canvas
Another useful tool, particularly when youâre zoomed in close or working on a large file, is the Hand tool. Try pressing and holding the [[Spacebar]] on your keyboard and youâll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If youâre working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
7. Create a Text layer
Next, letâs create some text. Press [[T]] to select the Text tool, and click anywhere within your iPhone SE frame to create a Text layer. This is going to be part of a button design, so letâs type âSign Inâ. Hit [[Escape]] to exit the Text tool.
8. Create a rectangle and arrange the layers
Press [[R]] to select the Rectangle tool. Drag a button-shaped rectangle around the text you just created.
Currently, the text is hidden underneath the rectangle. To fix this, we need to use Figmaâs âArrangeâ commands. Head over to the Layers panel on the left of the window. Select the âSign Inâ text layer, then right-click (PC/Mac) or ctrl-click (Mac) to bring up a list of options. Click âBring to frontâ, and the text will now be placed on top of the rectangle.
You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
[[â]][[]]]: bring forward
[[â]][[Opt]][[]]]: bring to front
[[â]][[[]]: send backward
[[â]][[Opt]][[[]]: send to back
PC:
[[Ctrl]][[]]]: bring forward
[[Ctrl]][[Shift â§]][[]]]: bring to front
[[Ctrl]][[[]]: send backward
[[Ctrl]][[Shift â§]][[[]]: send to back
9. Align the text and rectangle
This being a button, we want the text and rectangle shapes to be centered relative to one another. Figma has a set of âAlignâ commands that allow us to do this. Make sure that the Move tool is selected by pressing [[Escape]], or [[V]], and then drag a âmarqueeâ (a rectangular selection) around the text and the rectangle.
We can access the Align commands in the Properties (the interface area to the right of the window). Click âAlign Horizontal Centersâ and âAlign Vertical Centersâ to get the two objects nicely lined up.
10. Add rounded corners to the rectangle, and change the color
Select the rectangle shape you just created. In the Properties panel, there is a setting called âCorner Radiusâ, which allows us to make the corners of any shape rounded. Here, type in the number of pixels you want each corner to be rounded by.
To max out the corners and create semi-circles at each end of the rectangle, just enter a number larger than half the object height. (We set ours to 32 so that weâre covered in case we want to make the button a bit bigger later onâbut try out some different numbers and see what happens!)
The color settings can also be found in the Properties panel. We often want to attract peopleâs attention with buttonsâso select the rectangle, and pick a bright color! Weâve gone with a bright yellow by typing in a hex code (#EEEE33)âbut you can also click to open the color palette, and pick a color that way.
11. Change the font
With the text layer selected, you can access settings in the Properties panel to change the font, as well as font size, weight, and color. Weâve stuck with Inter, but switched up to bold and uppercase text. We also aligned the text to center. Try exploring the options!
Way to go!
That brings us to the end of Day 1 of Figma 101! Weâve found our way around the interface, tried out a few basic tools, and created a button that weâll be able to use in our app.
The final thing to do for today is to give our file a nameâto do this, just deselect all objects ([[Escape]] will do the trick), and click where it says âUntitledâ at the top of the window. Then type something like âFigma 101 Appâ. Thatâs it! Figma stores all your files in the cloud.
See you again tomorrow, when weâll be creating our first app screen.

Your first book was extremely helpful for me because, like yourself, I also started off as a pixel-pusher and I liked to make things look pretty without thinking too much of how design really functions. Your book has really helped me to fine-tune my skills in design!

Figma’s prototyping features allow you to create interactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs.
Prototypes are a fantastic way to:
Preview interactions and user flows
Share and iterate on ideas
Get feedback from collaborators
Test interactions with users
Present your designs to stakeholders
Watch our video on prototyping below. Or, check out our
Prototype & Collaboration Playlist
on Youtube.
Tip!
For an even more efficient workflow, you can quickly toggle between the
Design

tabs using the keyboard shortcut
Shift

.
Flows and starting points
With prototyping in Figma, you can create multiple flows for your prototype in one page to preview a user's full journey and experience through your designs.
A flow is the network of frames and connections in a single page. A prototype can map out a user's entire journey through your app or website, or it can focus on a specific segment of it via its own flow. For example: your prototype covers all possible interactions on an eCommerce site. Within the prototype, you have flows for creating an account, adding items to a cart, and checking out.
Figma creates a flow starting point when you add your first connection between two frames. There are a few other ways to add a flow starting point to your prototype:
With the starting frame selected, click
in the
Flow starting point
section of the right sidebar.
Right-click on the frame, then click
Add starting point
.
Duplicate a frame with an existing starting point.
When it's time to test your designs, you can share the entire prototype or
copy the link to a flow starting point
.
Learn more about starting points and flows →
Note:
A top-level frame can be part of multiple flows, but can only have one starting point. Frames nested within a top-level starting frame can have connections that navigate the user around multiple flows. For example,
Log in
and
Sign up
buttons can be nested in the same starting point frame, then be connected to frames in separate flows for each experience.
Create connections
Select the hotspot for the connection.
Click
to create the connection.
Drag it to the destination.
If there are no existing connections, Figma will make the first frame a starting point.
Tip!
You can create connections from multiple objects to the same destination frame at the same time—saving you time and effort when building out your prototype flows. To do so, select multiple starting hotspots on your canvas, then click and drag the
icon to the destination.

Glossary
A
hotspot
is where the Interaction takes place. A hotspot can be any object within the original frame, such as a link, button, image or icon, etc.
Connections
are the blue arrows or "noodles" that connect the hotspot to the destination. We apply the interaction and animation settings via the connection.
A
flow
is the network of connected frames that form a path through a prototype. Each flow has its own
starting point
. You can have multiple flows within a prototype.
The
starting point
is the first frame of a flow. Set multiple starting points to show different flows of the prototype in Presentation view.
The
trigger
determines what type of interaction with the hotspot will cause the prototype to advance. This could be a mouse or touch interaction, such as a tap, drag, click, hover, etc.
The
destination
is where the transition ends. This must be a top-level frame - a frame that is added directly to the canvas - and not an object within a frame. If we think of moving from A to B,
A
is the hotspot and
B
is the destination.
The
action
defines the type of progression is occurring in the prototype. For example, the action could be to navigate to another frame, or open an external URL.
The
animation
settings determine how the prototype moves from one frame to the other. You can control the type of animation, as well as the speed and direction.
A
transition
is the type of animation. This defines how the action moves to the destination.
The
direction
controls the direction that the transition comes from. Choose between left, right, top or bottom.
The
duration
controls the time it takes to complete the animation. The shorter the duration, the faster the transition. Select a duration between 1ms and 10000ms (10 seconds).
Easing
affects the acceleration of the animation
—
whether it starts slow or fast. This allows you to build animations that feel more natural.
Overlays
are frames that appear above the current screen or frame. You can use overlays to create tool-tips, interactive menus, alerts, or confirmations.
Overflow behavior
allows you to define how your prototype responds to scrolling. This allows you to create more advanced user interactions, such as carousels, galleries, or interactive maps.
Choose which
device
will be shown when presenting your prototype. Define both the device and the model.
The
background color
lets you define the color in the background of your prototype.
If you have a prototype with portrait and landscape frames, you can select an
orientation
. The orientation is set for the entire prototype. It's not possible to switch between portrait and landscape view within a prototype.
A
preview
will show you how something will look or work in the prototype. We show previews for both
animations
and prototype
device
settings.
